Software Systems Check

/*
Initial State:
*/
	Gear Pickup: Stowed and off
	Traction Feet: Retracted
	Intake Ramp: Stowed
	Shooter/Belt/Spinner: All off
	Wheels: Stopped
	Climber: Rachet Unlatched

/*
Action Tests:
*/
Wheels:
	Driver Joysticks drive test
	Check traction pads (all four corners)
	
	Driver DPad Down: Robot Centric (default)
	Driver DPad Up: Field Centric
	Driver DPad Left: Precision Mode (Robot centric @ 25% of normal)
	Driver DPad Right: Arcade Mode (no center wheel)
	
	Encoder Checks:
		While driving forward: Left side increases, Right side decreases
		While strafing: Going Left decreases count, going Right increases

Gear Pickup:
	Toggle Up/Down with Driver Right Trigger
	Intake / Release while Operator Left/Right Bumper Held
	Auto Pickup with Driver Left Bumper (same on Operator)
	Auto Deliver with Driver Right Bumper (same on Operator)
	
Traction Feet: 
	Deploy with Operator DPad Down;
	Retract with Operator DPad Up;
	Any joystick movement (X, Y, or Z) should cause retraction

Intake Ramp:
	Release using Operator DPad Right
	
Shooter / Belt / Spinner:
	Start Shooter & Belt using Driver Left Trigger
		- Left Trigger controls Spinner
		-Timeout after 10 seconds
		-Halt using Operator DPad Left
		- Operator X & B run Spinner FWD & BACK (Shooter keeps running)
		- Operator A & B run Belt UP & DOWN ( Shooter stops)
		- Smartdash buttons also control all three and shows tuning and speed data

Climber:
	Toggle Rachet using Driver Y button

TODO TODO TODO

1) Test DriveStraight command with Gyro enabled

2) Test DriveTurn command with Gyro

3) Turret implementation
	Check encoder counts while turning <done>

4) Vision tracking:
<done>Implement two Pixy setup
Fix frame-processing algorithm
Implement Gear Vision tracking
Test Shooter Vision
Test Gear Vision

5) Shooter ramp rate adjustment

??Automatically Switch drivebase from Speed mode to Voltage mode if an encoder is lost
