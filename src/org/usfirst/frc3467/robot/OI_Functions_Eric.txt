***** Operator Interface Functions ******

Triggers:
	(whenActive) - action is performed as soon as the control becomes active (i.e. button is pressed, stick is moved, etc.)
	(whileActive) - action is repeated continuously as long as control is active, and stops when control becomes inactive

Traction plates:
	- Go Down after Auto-Aiming or when Shooting
	- Traction plates should not go down until drivebase encoders show no (or minimal) velocity
	- On any drive joystick move -> traction plates come Up

Joysticks (Left and Right):
	Drive in various modes as determined by the DPad buttons:
		DPad Up = Field Centric Mode (default)	(whenActive)
		DPad Down = Robot Centric Mode		(whenActive)
		DPad Left = Precision Mode			(whenActive)
		DPad Right = Robot Centric (No CW)	(whenActive)

A Button - Auto-Aim & Shooter Power Up	(whileActive)
LT(Left Trigger) Power Up & Shoot ASAP	(whileActive)
		Auto-Aim:
			- Start Pixy camera high boiler goal tracking
			- Turn drivebase to aim at high boiler goal (any stick movement following this will cancel tracking; tracking may be resumed by entering Precision Drive mode (Y-button))
			- When on target, start spinner (slow) & drop traction plates
		Powering up the Shooter:
			-xxx Actuate Lower intake in
			-xxx Actuate High intake out
			- xxxRun Lower intake in
			- xxxRun High intake in
			- Run conveyor under Velocity control 
			- Run shooter wheels under Velocity Control (speed dependent on image in Pixy camers)
		Activating the Left Trigger does the following:
			- Run spinner at speed determined by Left Trigger movement (0.0 -> 1.0)
			- This permits Driver to control the flow of fuel out of the shooter, to allow for test shots, realignment, etc. without wasting a lot of fuel before proper alignment is achieved.
			
Y & B Buttons - Climb
	- Automated climber routine
	- Latch climber axle rachet; drive center wheel
	- Stop when center wheel current (read from PDB) reaches predetermined maximum value
	
X Button - "Zero" the Gyro
	- Save current setting as offset, and subtract from all subsequent readings.
			
LB(Left Bumper) Gear Catcher Down 		(whenActive)
		Gear Catcher down; roller running in
		When beam break indicates gear in, pause momentarily and then lift gear and stop roller at time TBD
		Possibly use current sensing to stop roller?
	
RB(Right Bumper) Gear Catcher Up			(whenActive)
		Lift Gear Catcher up; turn off roller
	
RT(Right Trigger) Gear Hang 		(whenActive)
		Gear Catcher - lower slowly (use air flow control) and run roller out (timing TBD)

Start Button - Switch between Speed and Voltage drive mode

X Button = RunSpinner Left		(whileActive)
B Button = RunSpinner Right		(whileActive)
Y Button = RunTower Up			(whileActive)
A Button = RunTower Down		(whileActive)

DPad (Directional Pad):
	DPad Up - Lift Traction Plates		(whenActive)
	DPad Down - Drop Traction Plates	(whenActive)
	xxxxxxDPad Left - Toggle Upper Intake position	(whenActive)
	xxxxxxDPad Right - Run Upper intake inward	(whileActive)


?Control? Climb Mode (whileActive)
	While in Climbing Mode:
		- Right (or Left?) Stick Y-axis controls climbing motor (whileActive)
		- Right Trigger locks climber rachet (whenActive)
